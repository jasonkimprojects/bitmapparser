# BitmapParser
***

A short header-only library to read, write, and make simple edits on bitmap images. Only images with 24-bit uncompressed color are supported, to keep the project simple.

*BitmapParser* was written over the summer of 2019 as a side project to study file processing, and for fun. Subsequent parts of my summer projects may build up on this library.

I referred to Google's style guide for C++ while writing *BitmapParser* for the sake of good readability, and the code has been checked with `cpplint`.

Last but not least, this library is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.
